  <div class="job one" data-text="CHEMICAL ENGINEERING">
    <p> The opportunities within chemical engineering are so broad, your role can be anything from transform raw materials into products via chemical processes, such as using oil to create plastics, fuel to power the world. Chemical engineers work in a variety of industries, including safety and risk, food and drink, textiles and pharmaceuticals, and the skills acquired from studying this course can be used to develope new products, from trial through to commercialisation, and making improvements to product lines and systems.Your skills could take you even beyond the world of engineering and can lead you into management, finance and business if you please. Click <a href="https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/job-sectors/engineering-and-manufacturing/overview-of-the-engineering-and-manufacturing-sector-in-the-uk">here</a> to find out how broad your career path can be with engineering.

<!--"Salary prospects for chemical engineers are good - graduate starting salaries are currently in the region of £28,500, with chartered chemical engineers earning up to £70,000."

Although realistically speaking most engineering jobs, in small companies can be lower than, this so you may not all be lucky to start on such a salary straight after graduating -->

  <div class="job two" data-text="MARINE ENGINEERING">
    <p> Ships, submarines and military vessels are just a selection of the vehicles you'll build, maintain and repair as a marine engineer (also known as a naval architect). You may also work on their water distillation and fuel systems, propulsion mechanics and ventilation systems, and test their engines for safe and efficient operation.

Some aspects of the job, such as on-ship inspections, require working in high-pressure, physically demanding environments. The design and research elements of your work, however, will take place in an office or laboratory.

A relevant degree, accredited by a body such as the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), will provide you with the technical and nautical knowledge, including use of complex computer systems and technical drawings, needed for this indust. <a href="https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/job-sectors/engineering-and-manufacturing/5-exciting-careers-in-engineering">here</a> to find out how broad your career path can be with engineering.</p>
